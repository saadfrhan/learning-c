/*
    c is a compiled language
    because unlike an interpreted language like python which 
    throws an error when it have reached the line of the error
    the c language does not let you get an executable of 
    your file until you fix all the errors in your file.
    if you have an error in your c file it will throw the error
    and do not let you get an executable
